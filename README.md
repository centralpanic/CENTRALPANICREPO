Amphetamines in Urine Staff members of the Department of Legal Medicine, Hiroshima University School of Medicine and the Department of Legal Medicine, Fukuoka University School of Medicine have developed an accurate, simple, and rapid method for analyzing urine for methamphetamine and its principal metabolite, amphetamine, using heated headspace SPME and capillary GC (6). The investi- gators seal a 1mL urine sample in a 12mL vial, add internal standard (5µg pentadeuterated methamphetamine, prepared according to reference 7) and 0.7g potassium carbonate, and heat the sample at 80°C for 20 minutes on a block heater. They then expose an SPME fiber coated with 100µm of PDMS to the headspace above the sample for 5 minutes, then introduce the fiber into the injection port of the chromatograph. In a system equipped with mass spectrometry/chemical ionization selected ion monitoring (GC-MS/CI-SIM), this analysis was 20 times as sensitive as a method incorporating conventional headspace extraction (Figure C). Correlation coefficients for methamphet- amine and amphetamine, based on d5-methamphetamine, were 0.9999 for concentrations of 0.2–10mg/liter and 0.9970 for concentrations of 5–100mg/liter (Figure D). Coefficients of varia- tion for amphetamine and methamphetamine at 5mg/liter in urine were 7.0% and 5.1%, respectively.

IN the last decades, the amount of web-based information available has increased dramatically. How to gather useful information from the web has become a challenging issue for people. Current web information gathering systems attempt to satisfy user requirements by capturing their information needs. For this purpose, user profiles are created for user background knowledge description. User profiles represent the concept models possessed by users when gathering web information. A concept model is implicitly possessed by users and is generated from their background knowledge.

While this concept model cannot be proven I've seen it in peoples behavior. When users read through a document or look through a repository, they can easily determine whether or not it is of their interest or relevance to them, a judgment that arises from their implicit concept models. If a user’s concept model can be simulated, then a superior
representation of user profiles can be built.

To simulate users (you guys) concept models, a knowledge description and formalization model will be utilized in personalized web information gathering, this is called an ontology. Such ontologies are called ontological user profiles  or personalized ontologies. 8)

Personalized ontologies are a conceptualization model that formally describes and specifies user background knowledge.

And, I can tell that y'all are pretty knowledgeable being here and from observations in daily life, I've found that web users might have different expectations for the same search query. For example, for the topic “New York,” business travelers may demand different information from leisure travelers. Sometimes even the same user may have different expectations for the same search query if applied in a different situation. A user may become a business traveler when planning for a business trip, or a leisure traveler when planning for a family holiday. Based on this an assumption is formed that web users have a personal concept model for their information needs. A user’s concept model may change according to different information needs. When you visit me in this area/section, a model constructing personalized ontologies for each one you, based in what you'd like to see here (your concept model) I'll in turn try to cater for.

That said, I'll come back later and expand on this. In the meantimme, tell me what you think !

... automatic face identiﬁcation of characters in movies has drawn signiﬁcant research interests and led to many
interesting applications. It is a challenging problem due to the huge variation in the appearance of each character. Although existing methods demonstrate promising results in clean environments, the performances are limited in complex movie scenes due to the noises generated during the face tracking and face clustering process. Today I'll present two schemes of global face-name matching based frameworks for robust character identiﬁcation.
